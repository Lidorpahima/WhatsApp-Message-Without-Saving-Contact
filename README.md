        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever wanted to send a message on WhatsApp to a phone number without saving it to your contacts? 
            Many users face this inconvenience when they need to communicate quickly with someone, such as a business contact or a new acquaintance. 
            The "WhatsApp Without Saving Number" application addresses this issue by allowing you to generate a direct link to send a message, eliminating the need to save the number first.
        </p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            This application provides a simple and intuitive graphical interface. Users can enter a phone number, and the software will generate a clickable link that opens WhatsApp directly to that number's chat. 
            This means you can initiate conversations quickly without cluttering your contact list with temporary numbers.
